File Scanner:\n   - Class Name: FileScanner\n   - Purpose: This class will be responsible for scanning the project folder, reading the files, and performing analysis on them.\n\n2. Error Checker:\n   - Class Name: ErrorChecker\n   - Purpose: This class will analyze the content of the files and identify any errors in the HTML structure, missing pages, or broken links.\n\n3. Page Fixer:\n   - Class Name: PageFixer\n   - Purpose: This class will fix the identified errors in the HTML pages and ensure proper linking between pages.\n\n4.

Install dependencies:\n   - If using Python, create a virtual environment:\n     ```\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     ```\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     ```\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - Install the required packages:\n     ```\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n2. Run the codebase:\n   - Start by running the file scanner:\n     ```\n     python file_scanner.py\n     ```\n   - Once the file scanning is complete, proceed to run the error checker:\n     ```\n     python error_checker.py\n     ```\n   - After the error checking, run the page fixer:\n     ```\n     python page_fixer.py\n     ```\n   - Next, run the UI improver:\n     ```\n     python ui_improver.py\n     ```\n   - Then, run the photo tab creator:\n     ```\n     python photo_tab_creator.py\n     ```\n   - Finally, run the photo viewer:\n     ```\n     python photo_viewer.py\n     ```\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `python` with the appropriate command if you are using a different programming language."}]
