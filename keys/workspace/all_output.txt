Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the step-by-step plan:

1. File Scanner:
   - Class Name: FileScanner
   - Purpose: This class will be responsible for scanning the project folder, reading the files, and performing analysis on them.

2. Error Checker:
   - Class Name: ErrorChecker
   - Purpose: This class will analyze the content of the files and identify any errors in the HTML structure, missing pages, or broken links.

3. Page Fixer:
   - Class Name: PageFixer
   - Purpose: This class will fix the identified errors in the HTML pages and ensure proper linking between pages.

4. UI Improver:
   - Class Name: UIImprover
   - Purpose: This class will implement the required improvements in the UI, such as enhancing the visual design, layout, and user experience.

5. Photo Tab Creator:
   - Class Name: PhotoTabCreator
   - Purpose: This class will create the necessary files and stylize them to add a photo tab to the website.

6. Photo Viewer:
   - Class Name: PhotoViewer
   - Purpose: This class will handle the gathering of photos and display them in the photo tab and the separate page for mocked-up photos.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their content.

1. `file_scanner.py`:
```python
class FileScanner:
    def __init__(self, project_folder):
        self.project_folder = project_folder

    def scan_files(self):
        # Code to scan the project folder and retrieve the list of files
        pass

    def read_file(self, file_path):
        # Code to read the content of a file
        pass
```

2. `error_checker.py`:
```python
class ErrorChecker:
    def __init__(self, file_content):
        self.file_content = file_content

    def check_html_errors(self):
        # Code to check for HTML syntax errors in the file content
        pass

    def check_missing_pages(self):
        # Code to check for missing pages or broken links
        pass
```

3. `page_fixer.py`:
```python
class PageFixer:
    def __init__(self, file_content):
        self.file_content = file_content

    def fix_html_errors(self):
        # Code to fix HTML syntax errors in the file content
        pass

    def fix_missing_pages(self):
        # Code to create missing pages or fix broken links
        pass
```

4. `ui_improver.py`:
```python
class UIImprover:
    def __init__(self, file_content):
        self.file_content = file_content

    def improve_visual_design(self):
        # Code to enhance the visual design of the website
        pass

    def improve_layout(self):
        # Code to improve the layout of the website
        pass

    def improve_user_experience(self):
        # Code to enhance the user experience of the website
        pass
```

5. `photo_tab_creator.py`:
```python
class PhotoTabCreator:
    def __init__(self, project_folder):
        self.project_folder = project_folder

    def create_photo_tab_files(self):
        # Code to create the necessary files for the photo tab
        pass

    def stylize_photo_tab(self):
        # Code to stylize the photo tab files
        pass
```

6. `photo_viewer.py`:
```python
class PhotoViewer:
    def __init__(self, photo_folder):
        self.photo_folder = photo_folder

    def gather_photos(self):
        # Code to gather photos from the specified source or folder
        pass

    def display_photos(self):
        # Code to display the gathered photos in the photo tab and the separate page
        pass
```

Please note that the above code snippets only provide the class definitions and method placeholders. The actual implementation of the methods will depend on the specific requirements and the chosen programming language.

Next, we will proceed with creating the necessary files for the project and organizing them in a suitable directory structure.
